# DaemonBite Retro Controllers To USB Adapters
## Introduction
This is just a slight change to the SNES/NES code to allow for 4 ports (2 NES / 2 SNES)

## How to assemble the adapters
See the README files in the subfolders for build instructions. All the adapters are build around the Arduino Pro Micro.

## Building the projects
You will need the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to build the projects. Download the whole repository via the "Clone or download" button, open the project you want to build in the IDE and select "Arduino Leonardo" in Tools / Board. Connect the Arduino to a USB port and build/upload from Scetch / Upload.
